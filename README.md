# LinkCheck
Uses Python to check whether a link on a website exists and if it does, notifies the user. Else, keeps looping.
Application:
  Originally conceived to be notified when the torrent for a TV show is out.
Planned changes:
  To download the file and send it to Flud's watched directory in the mobile device where it automatically starts downloading.
